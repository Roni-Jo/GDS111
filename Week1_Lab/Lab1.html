    <p style="font-size: larger;"> Hello, welcome to my webpage I'm RJ. I currently live on 
        campus, and I grew up in the middle of nowhere Maine.
        I attend New England Institute of Technology
        for video game development and design.
        I haven't had much experience with writing code, 
        but I'm hoping to pick it up fairly quickly. All though I tend not to talk
        alot when I first meet people, eventually I'll get used to it and start talking more.
     </p>
     <p style="font-size: larger;"> I hope to eventually make video games, 
        wether it's by myself or with a small team.
        There's a couple of types of games I would like to make, including horror and/or 
        fantasy themed platformers. I also have a couple of themes for games I'd like
        to make someday. I collect old consoles and cameras, as well as 
        things like record players and jars.
    </p>
