            <p> Hello I'm RJ, I currently live on campus at New England Institute of Technology. I grew up in the middle of nowhere Maine, and decided to attened NEIT for video game development and design. I haven't had much experience with writing code, but I'm hoping to pick it up fairly quickly. I hope to eventually make video games, wether it's by myself or with a small team. There's a couple of types of games I would like to make, including horror and/or fantasy themed platformers. I also have a couple of themes for games I'd like to make someday. I collect old consoles and cameras, as well as things like record players and jars.
